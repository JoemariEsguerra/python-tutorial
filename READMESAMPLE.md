# What is Python Syntax?

##### Python Syntax refers to the set of rules and conventions that dictate how Python code should be written and structured. It has some key points which are:
        -Indentation: Uses indentation to define code blocks. 
        -Comments: Start with # and are ignored by the interpreter.
        -Variables: No need to declare types, just assign values.
        -Data Types: Include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.
        -Control Structures: If statements, loops (for, while), try-except blocks.
        -Functions: Defined with def keyword.
        -Classes: Defined with class keyword.
        -Modules and Packages: Used for organizing code into reusable components.
